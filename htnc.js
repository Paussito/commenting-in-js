//Comment are useful to explain why do you write a code, example:
let var1 //This creates a variable // ❌ You mustn't explain what the codes does, itselfs does it.
let var2 //I create this variable for making a condition for "If" // ✅ This is the correct form of commenting.

//---------//

//A longer example:
let var3 = 17 //We create the age of the person
let var4 = "You can pass" //The first message that will be showed
let var5 = "You can't pass" // And the second

if(var3 >= 18) {  //We start with the condition if he's over 18
    console.log(var4) //It print "You can pass"
} else { //If you are not over 18...
    console.log(var5) //It prints "You can't pass"
} //All of this is a example of making a DISCOTHEQUE verification

// ✅ This is the correct form of commenting. //
